# Reorganize

You can activate a rearrange state to let your users rearrange it.

    var dashboard = fluanceDashboard.get('simple-demo');
    dashboard.toggleSortable();

You can test is dashboard is sorting :

    if (dashboard.isStateSorting) {
        // execute code if sorting mode is enabled
    }

Or maybe when sorting is finished?

    if (!dashboard.isStateSorting) {
        // execute code if sorting mode is disabled
    }
